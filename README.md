# ÂµGame - OpenGL

## About the project

This project is a game prototype of game created with **SDL2** and **openGL** for linux (I guess you could easily find a way to compile it for windows but I never tested it).

The main goal of the project is to learn how game motors works and how to use libraries such as openGL to work with the GPU.

## Dependencies

- libsdl2-dev
- libsdl2-ttf
- libsdl2-img
- openGL
- make
- clang++

## Compile the project

you can use the make file of the project to compile the code into an executable as so :

```bash
$ make
```

## Run the project

Once you got yourself your compiled version, you can execute the game binary

```bash
$ ./game
```
